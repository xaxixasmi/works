    <h2 class="subheading" style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 50px;">Born and raised in Manila, now in Manhattan, I recently graduated from Parsons School of Design with a Bachelor of Fine Arts, majoring in Communication Design and minoring in Fine Arts. My passions include creating art, editing videos, designing books, coding websites, composing music, applying special effects makeup, and much more. <br></br> Growing up in diverse family backgrounds has deeply ingrained in me a profound respect for different cultures and viewpoints. This upbringing has cultivated my ability to listen without bias and navigate complexities with empathy and diplomacy. Whether in personal or professional settings, I prioritize inclusivity and fairness, seeking compromises that embrace all voices and identities. <a href="Resume - Tati Yasmi.pdf">Resume</a> + <a href="Tati's Portfolio.pdf">PDF Portfolio</a>
